Implementation notes and comments:

	1. Added serialVersion for all Serializable classes (Entities)
		/**
	 	* serialVersion required for Serializable classes.
	 	* -> It is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID values, 
	 	* since the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending 
	 	* on compiler implementations, and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization.
	 	*/
	2. Added not null & unique constraints where it's usefull 
		! Weather has a unique constraint combined out of two attributes (The idea is to prevent duplicated pairs/records in the table)
	3. Created default Repositories
	4. Created and stored Test Data at application startup
		- Utilization Data for Lifts and Gastronomies is kind of summary. One entry per hour per weather and per lift/gastronomy 
			with random utilization Number
	5. Created default RestControllers accessible at:
		-> http://localhost:8081/skiapp/persons
